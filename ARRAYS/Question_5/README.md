### **Question 5: Find the Minimum and Maximum Element in an Array**

### **Problem Statement**

Given an array of integers, your task is to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array. You need to provide solutions that minimize the number of comparisons.

#### **Example**
- Input: `arr = [3, 5, 1, 2, 4, 8, -1]`
- Output: 
  - Minimum: `-1`
  - Maximum: `8`

### **Naive Approach (Linear Traversal)**

#### **Explanation**
1. Use a single traversal of the array to find both the minimum and maximum values.
2. Initialize `min_element` and `max_element` to the first element of the array.
3. Iterate through the array and update:
   - `min_element` if the current value is smaller.
   - `max_element` if the current value is larger.

#### **Steps**
- Traverse the array and perform two comparisons for each element.

#### **Time Complexity**
- \( O(n) \), as the array is traversed once.

#### **Space Complexity**
- \( O(1) \), no extra space is used.

### **Best Approach (Tournament Method)**

#### **Explanation**
1. Divide the array into two halves and recursively find the minimum and maximum of each half.
2. Compare the minimums and maximums from the two halves to get the global minimum and maximum.
3. This reduces the number of comparisons compared to the naive approach.

#### **Steps**
- Divide the array into smaller subarrays until they contain one or two elements.
- Compare elements only when merging results.

#### **Time Complexity**
- \( O(n) \), as the array is divided into halves recursively.
- The number of comparisons is reduced to \( 3n/2 - 2 \).

#### **Space Complexity**
- \( O(\log n) \), due to recursion stack space.

### **Example**

#### **Input**:
`arr = [3, 5, 1, 2, 4, 8, -1]`

#### **Output**:
- **Naive Approach**: 
  - Minimum: `-1`
  - Maximum: `8`
- **Best Approach**: 
  - Minimum: `-1`
  - Maximum: `8`
